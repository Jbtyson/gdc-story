To update your branch with master:
- Checkout your branch
- Merge master into your branch
- Ex:

	git checkout master
	git pull origin master 
		Note that this will pull the latest information for you.

	git checkout <mybranch>
	git merge master
	
Merge conflicts will arise. Merge conflicts are pieces of code that have conflicting information, this may 
arise if two people have changed the same line of code or two people have adjusted the same piece of code.

When you try to merge, look at the fiels where conflicts have arisen, if you look in the code, it should look 

something like this:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<HEAD
"CODE section 1"
=============
"CODE section 2"
>>>>>>>>>>>> "Commit comment"

To fix these, you must go through and choose the working piece of code, if I knew that "CODE section 2" was the 

piece of code I wanted, I would delete everything around it but the line I wanted. SO make sure to delete <<<Head 

through to the ===== and then the >>>>>>>>>> at the end.

Do this for all of files that are listed with merge conflicts. Once you have, run the following command.
	git add .
	git commit -a -m "Fixed merge conflicts arisen with merging branch" or soemthing along those lines. 

To update your branch with develop:
- Checkout your branch
- Merge develop into your branch
- Ex:
	git checkout <mybranch>
	git merge develop

Once you have working code that you would like submitted, go ahead and run the following commands:

	git commit -a -m "Message of what your code does"
	git push origin <yourbranchname>

Once you have done this, got to github.com and make a pull request to develop. The link below will show you how.
